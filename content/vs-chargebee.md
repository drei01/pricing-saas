### Cost

PriceWell is **much cheaper** than Chargebee. When you sign up to Chargebee, you will be asked to guess your monthly revenue and charged you based on that. **Plus** you get charged if you make more money than you said you would! At PriceWell, we simply charge a pertentage of your subscription payments, no hidden costs if you make more money (heck, we might even send you a cake). The deal is simple, if you grow we grow.

### Keep your own branding

You don't want to whisk them off to some other webpage that looks nothing like the one they came from. With PriceWell's drag and drop pricing pages, you control exactly how it looks. We don't use hosted pages with bright orange banners all over them.

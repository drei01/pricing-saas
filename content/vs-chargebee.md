## PriceWell vs Chargebee

###Â Cost

PriceWell is <b>much cheaper</b> than Chargebee. They ask you to guess your monthly revenue and charge you based on that <b>plus</b> you get charged if you make more money than you said you would! At PriceWell, we simply charge you based on your MRR, no hidden costs if you make more money (heck, we might even send you a cake).

### Complex Platform vs Simplicity

The Chargebee platform is just overkill for most SaaS businesses.

Non-Technical founders choose PriceWell over Chargify every day. Here’s why PriceWell is the number one choice for founders who aren’t developers. Take the simplicity, simple and reasonable pricing and stupendous customer support into account when comparing Chargify alternatives.

### Subscription Billing Software

Chargify is a powerful subscription billing software platform for b2b saas, but can be complicated and difficult to use. PriceWell offers many of the same billing system, payment processing and billing scenarios but it is more user-friendly and easy to integrate. PriceWell lets you build a subscription plan and invite customers quickly, while still providing a comprehensive billing solution. Plus, the dynamic customer-facing dashboard and streamlined unsubscribe process make it easy for customers to manage their accounts. PriceWell prides itself on its customer-friendly features, transparent pricing structures, and exceptional customer service. PriceWell is the Chargify for non-technical founders.

### Swap over engineering for simplicity

Your SaaS billing software should be simple. Chargify handles, saas billing, accounting, data and analytics. Great, you may think, but are they really masters at any of it or just mediocre at everything. If you just want to get started today collecting subscription payments from your customers then choose PriceWell, a platform focussed on one thing. Not because we can’t do accounting, data blah blah blah, but because we want to give saas businesses the best billing platform.

### Dedicated Customer Support

Do you know what obsessive customer support feels like? It’s when you have a problem in the middle of the night and you just on the customer support chat. George from PriceWell helps you fix the issue in a few minutes without so much as a question about why you are trying to do this in the middle of the night on a Sunday. We’re there for you now matter what day of the week your perfecting your billing flow. Is Chargify, Chargebee or any of this big players going to do that for you? Of course not, they’ll send you into an endless support queue, pass you between “operators“ wish you a nice day and then say “it looks like you aren’t responding, I’m going to close this chat“. They don’t have time to spend one-on-one with their customers. As a small  company ourselves, we know what it’s like. That’s why we’re different, support is our number one priority. We know that helping you create value for your customers is key to both your and our growth. It's a symbiotic relationship and if we aint the pilot fish to your shark....

### Customer Portal as standard

Letting your customers manage their own subscriptions is key for b2b SaaS companies like yours. Recurring billing is great but if you have to log into the Stripe dashboard every time a customer wants an invoice you're in for a lot of work. The PriceWell self service Customer Portal let's customer manage their own invoices, update credit cards and upgrade their plans

### When is PriceWell not right?

If you need multiple payment gateways,  revenue recognition, and to automate tax collection then your enterprise needs are more suited to Chargify. We will always tell you when we think you aren't the right fit. If, on the other hand, you just want the simplest way to get paid recurring payments with a variety of payment methods. Then PriceWell is for you.

### Where is Chargify based?

That depends who's asking. They have offices in Atlanta, Georgia, San Antonio, Texas, Krakow, Poland, and Dublin, Ireland. Since they were acquired by Scaleworks in 2016 they because a portfolio company under the larger SaaS business holding company. They are in the process of merging two of the companies Chargify and SaaSOptics to become Maxio (what ever that means). You can bet their pricing plans are about to go up market so hold on to your wallets. If your subscription business wants to keep the majority of it's revenue, choose PriceWell.

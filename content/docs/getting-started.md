With PriceWell, you can get your subscription billing up and running in minutes. The following quick start guide will help you through the process

## Set up Stripe

The first step is to [create a PriceWell account](https://app.pricewell.io/register)
If you already have a Stripe account, you don't need to do anything special here.

Once you have registered your PriceWell account, you will be asked to connect your Stripe account. If you don't have an account already don't worry, you can create one in the next step.

**Click the "Connect Stripe" button.**

You will be taken to stripe.com and be asked to either sign in to your existing account or create a new one. *You don't have to have all the details of your business here*, just the basics like name, address etc. You can fill the rest in later (Stripe will prompt you via email).

Once you have connected your Stripe account, you will be taken back to PriceWell. The first page you will see is the dashboard. This looks a little empty at the moment but don't worry, it'll look more lively once we have our first pricing page

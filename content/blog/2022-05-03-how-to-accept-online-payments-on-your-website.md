2. ### Payment Gateways
3. ### Mobile Payments
4. ### Payment links

Let’s dig into them…



# **Credit and Debit Cards**

Almost 70% of the United States population [carries a credit card](https://shiftprocessing.com/credit-card/) with the ⅓ of them using [3 or more credit cards](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/credit-card-ownership-usage-statistics/#:~:text=Key%20credit%20card%20statistics,most%20recent%20data%20from%20Experian.) during a regular week.\
\
No matter what business you own, accepting credit and debit cards should be on top of your thoughts when it comes to payments.

But an important thing to keep in mind is that accepting debit or credit cards requires a merchant account.Good news though, if you are a brick-and-mortar shop going online, you already have a merchant account with the bank you are using.

- - -

`Merchant account or CC processing is a type of bank account which enables you to accept online payments.`

Just to have an underlying understanding of the processes used in a merchant account:

* Customer makes the purchase
* Merchant account checks funds availability
* Transaction is verified by card company (MasterCard, Visa)
* Money enters your bank account

Usually, the funds arrive with a delay of 2 business days, while payment is verified, authorized and deemed secure. 

Things to remember:\
✔️Merchant account is a bank account, so you can connect it to\
     your website as you can with any other bank account.\
✔️ You can easily open a merchant account at almost any bank\
      ($10-30 flat fee per month)**\
✔️**Credit Cards you can accept: VISA, MasterCard and American \
     Express



# Payment Gateways

In plain English, a payment gateway connects your website to a checkout. Either embedding a checkout on your website or redirecting customers to the payment gateway’s own website, these software link your website to Visa, MasterCard and American Express.



## **Stripe**

Braintree is a service owned by Paypal -and a Stripe alternative for most SaaS companies-\
Similar to Stripe, Braintree is a payment gateway, merchant account, and subscription management platform.

### Braintree Fees

* **`Setup fee`**
* **`Online transaction fee`**
* **`Invoice Costs: `**

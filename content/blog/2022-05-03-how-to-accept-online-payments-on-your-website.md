But an important thing to keep in mind is that accepting debit or credit cards requires a merchant account.Good news though, if you are a brick-and-mortar shop going online, you already have a merchant account with the bank you are using.

- - -

`Merchant account or CC processing is a type of bank account which enables you to accept online payments.`

Just to have an underlying understanding of the processes used in a merchant account:

* Customer makes the purchase
* Merchant account checks funds availability
* Transaction is verified by card company (MasterCard, Visa)
* Money enters your bank account

Usually, the funds arrive with a delay of 2 business days, while payment is verified, authorized and deemed secure. 

Things to remember:\
✔️Merchant account is a bank account, so you can connect it to\
     your website as you can with any other bank account.\
✔️ You can easily open a merchant account at almost any bank\
      ($10-30 flat fee per month)**\
✔️**Credit Cards you can accept: VISA, MasterCard and American \
     Express

## Payment Gateways

In plain English, a payment gateway connects your website to a checkout. Either embedding a checkout on your website or redirecting customers to the payment gateway’s own website, these software link your website to Visa, MasterCard and American Express.

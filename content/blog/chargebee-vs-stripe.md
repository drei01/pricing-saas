Are you considering Chargebee and wondering what the difference is with Stripe Billing? Then you are in the right place.

Chargebee is a subscription billing platform that works with multiple payment providers (Stripe included). Chargebee helps companies manage their subscription payments.

Stripe is the worlds largest payment provider and they have their own subscription billing platform called Stripe Billing. While not as fully featured as Chargebee, Stripe Billing has everything a SaaS business could need to manage their subscription billing.

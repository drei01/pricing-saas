PayPal charges around 3.49% + a fixed fee (depending on your deal with them). The amount PayPal charges is different in different situations and depending on the payment method.

### Adyen pricing

Adyen (another payment processor) doesn't charge a transaction fee at all. Instead they charge something called an [interchange fee](https://www.adyen.com/blog/interchange-fees-explained). This is a fee between 0.3% and 2% of the transaction amount. Adyen also has a minimum monthly fee of $120 so smaller online businesses might want to look for an alternative credit card processor like Stripe.

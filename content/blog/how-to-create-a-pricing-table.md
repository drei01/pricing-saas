Pricing Tables are a vital part of your business. If you get your pricing wrong, you could be leaving a lot of money on the table. In the early stages of your business you'll want to experiment with your pricing regularly. That's why it's important to create a Pricing Table that you can update quickly. When it comes to building your own pricing table, you have a few options:

- [HTML (~ 4 hours)]({{< ref "how-to-create-a-pricing-table#how-to-create-a-pricing-table-with-html" >}})
- [WordPress (~ 1 hour)]({{< ref "how-to-create-a-pricing-table#how-to-create-a-pricing-table-with-wordpress" >}})
- [Webflow (~ 1 hour)]({{< ref "how-to-create-a-pricing-table#how-to-create-a-pricing-table-with-webflow" >}})
- [PriceWell (~ 15 minutes)]({{< ref "how-to-create-a-pricing-table#how-to-create-a-pricing-table-with-html" >}})

## How to Create a Pricing Table with HTML

First you are going to decide whether you want to use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind (maybe your website is built with something already).

Of course this is only the HTML structure, now you want to connect all the "Buy Now" buttons. You could use [Stripe Payment Links](https://stripe.com/en-gb-de/payments/payment-links) for this but that makes it tricky if you want to change pricing as you have to remember where you pasted all the links and which pricing they link to. For a quicker and easier way, see the end of this article.

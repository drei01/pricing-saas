## Understanding Google Spreadsheet Permissions

![man in a green jacket working on spreadsheets at his desk](/img/google-sheets/understand-google-sheets-permissions.jpeg)

Google Sheets is a powerful tool for collaboration, allowing multiple people to work on the same document at the same time. However, it's important to understand the different levels of permissions available in order to control who can access and edit your spreadsheets.

### Ownership

The person who creates a Google Sheet is automatically granted ownership of the document. This means they have full control over the document, including the ability to share it with others and change the permissions of other users. It's important to note that ownership cannot be transferred to another user.

### Editor

Editors can make changes to the document, including adding and deleting content. They can also share the document with others and change the permissions of other users, but they cannot delete the document or transfer ownership.

### Commenter

Commenters can view the document and leave comments, but they cannot make any changes to the content. They can also reply to comments left by other users. Commenters cannot share the document with others or change the permissions of other users.

### Viewer

Viewers can only view the document and cannot make any changes or leave comments. They cannot share the document with others or change the permissions of other users.

It's important to carefully consider the level of permissions you grant to users when sharing a Google Sheet. For example, if you want someone to review the document without making any changes, you would want to grant them Viewer or Commenter access. If you want someone to collaborate on the document with you, you would grant them Editor access.

## Creating a Google Spreadsheet

To give access to a Google Spreadsheet, one must first create a new spreadsheet. This can be done by following these simple steps:

1. Open Google Drive and click on the "New" button in the top left corner of the screen.
2. Select "Google Sheets" from the dropdown menu.
3. A new spreadsheet will open, ready for editing.

Once the spreadsheet is created, the user can start adding data and formatting the sheet as needed. It's important to note that the user who creates the spreadsheet is automatically given ownership of the document.

To ensure that the spreadsheet is properly organized and easy to navigate, it's recommended to add column headers and format the data in a clear and concise manner. This can be done by selecting the cells to be formatted and using the formatting options in the toolbar at the top of the screen.

It's also important to regularly save the spreadsheet to avoid losing any data. This can be done by clicking on "File" in the top left corner of the screen and selecting "Save" or "Save As" from the dropdown menu.

Overall, creating a Google Spreadsheet is a simple process that can be done in just a few clicks. By following these steps and taking the time to properly format and organize the data, users can ensure that their spreadsheet is easy to use and accessible to others.

## Granting Access to a Google Spreadsheet

## Revoking Access to a Google Spreadsheet

Sometimes, it may be necessary to revoke access to a Google Spreadsheet. This can be done easily by following a few simple steps.

First, open the Google Spreadsheet that you want to revoke access to. Next, click on the "Share" button located in the top right-hand corner of the screen. This will open the "Share with others" window.

In the "Share with others" window, you will see a list of people who currently have access to the Google Spreadsheet. To revoke access to a specific person, simply click on the drop-down menu next to their name and select "Remove".

If you want to revoke access to multiple people at once, you can do so by selecting the check box next to each person's name and then clicking on the "Remove" button located at the bottom of the window.

It's important to note that when you revoke access to a Google Spreadsheet, the person's ability to view, edit, or comment on the document will be immediately removed. However, any changes they made to the document prior to revoking their access will still be visible.

In summary, revoking access to a Google Spreadsheet is a simple process that can be done in just a few clicks. By following these steps, you can ensure that your document remains secure and accessible only to those who need it.

## Selling Access to a Google Spreadsheet

![Man with glasses sat at a desk with two monitors, working on spreadsheets](/img/google-sheets/managing-google-sheets-access-levels.jpeg)

You are allowed to sell access to your Google Spreadsheet. However, there are some things you should know before you do so. There are a lot of "guides" on how to easily sell access to Google Spreadsheets using the Shareable Link functionality. However, this can lead to your spreadsheets being leaked as anyone with the link can share it with someone else.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Do not use Shareable Links to sell your Google Spreadsheets. This can lead to your spreadsheets being **leaked** as anyone with the link can share it with someone else.

The best way to sell access to your Google Spreadsheet is to use a platform like [PriceWell](/gated-content). PriceWell automatically adds your customers email address to the share settings of your spreadsheet after they have paid. Now you don't have to worry about your spreadsheets being leaked or shared with others.

## Best Practices for Sharing Google Spreadsheets

![two large computer monitors displaying google sheets and charts](/img/google-sheets/google-sheets-best-practices.jpeg)

Sharing Google Spreadsheets can be a great way to collaborate with colleagues, clients, and other stakeholders. However, it is important to follow some best practices to ensure that your data remains secure and only the right people have access to it.

Here are some best practices for sharing Google Spreadsheets:

### 1\. Limit Access to Only the Necessary People

When sharing a Google Spreadsheet, it is important to only give access to the necessary people. This means that you should only share the spreadsheet with those who need to see it and not with everyone in your organisation. This will help to keep your data secure and reduce the risk of data breaches.

### 2\. Use the Appropriate Sharing Settings

Google Sheets offers a variety of sharing settings, including view-only, edit access, and comment-only access. It is important to use the appropriate sharing setting for each user to ensure that they have the level of access they need to complete their work. For example, if you only want someone to view the spreadsheet, then you should give them view-only access.

### 3\. Keep Track of Who Has Access

It is important to keep track of who has access to your Google Spreadsheet. This will help you to ensure that only the necessary people have access and that you can revoke access if necessary. You can view who has access to your spreadsheet by clicking on the "Share" button in the top-right corner of the screen.

### 4\. Use Password Protection

If you are sharing sensitive data, then you may want to consider using password protection. This will ensure that only those who have the password can access the spreadsheet. You can set a password for your Google Spreadsheet by clicking on "File" and then "Protect sheets and ranges".

### 5\. Review Access Regularly

It is important to review who has access to your Google Spreadsheet regularly. This will help you to identify any users who no longer need access and revoke their access if necessary. You should also review the sharing settings regularly to ensure that each user has the appropriate level of access.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your Google Spreadsheet remains secure and only the necessary people have access to it.

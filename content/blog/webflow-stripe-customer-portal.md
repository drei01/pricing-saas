Integrating Stripe with Webflow can be a pain. You don't have a backend so there's no where to store your customer's details to let them login and access the Stripe Billing Portal. Rejoice, we have the solution. PriceWell's Customer Portal can be embedded directly in Webflow without any code at all. Simply copy our snippet into a webflow embed.

What's more, the passwordless login (via email) sends your customers a direct link to their Stripe Customer Portal and lets them manage their subscription. Update their credit card, view invoices, upgrade plan and cancel. All of this is configurable so you decide what your customers can and can't do.

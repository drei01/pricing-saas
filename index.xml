Your customer makes a purchase and provides their payment details. When you try to charge their credit card, the payment information goes through what&amp;rsquo;s called a Payment Gateway. The payment gateway passes the information on to the cardholder’s bank who will approve or decline the transaction. If the transaction is approved, the funds are transferred from the cardholder’s account to your Stripe account (minus any applicable fees). If the transaction is declined, no funds are transferred.</description></item><item><title>Book a Free Demo</title><link>https://www.pricewell.com/book-free-demo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 15:16:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.pricewell.com/book-free-demo/</guid><description>Book a Demo Need Help Deciding if PriceWell is For You?
